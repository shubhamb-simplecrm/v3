## Backend

### Enhancements
  - **Optimized Security Group Access Check for Listview Performance** This update improves performance in the listview, subpanel listview, and popup view by reducing the number of queries made for security group access checks. Instead of running a query for each record, the system now retrieves all record IDs in a single batch and performs the access control checks efficiently, significantly boosting performance. [#PR 1002](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/1002) 
  
  :::danger Important
  - **Removed Delete button from list view for V267** 
  The delete button has been removed from the V267 list view to prevent data integrity issues caused by incomplete deletions that created orphan records. This change addresses major impacts on roles, where associated actions were not deleted, leading to incorrect ACL configurations. 
  Users can now delete records via Mass Delete or Detail View, ensuring proper data handling. 
  Additionally, SQL queries have been provided to identify and clean up existing orphan records.  
  **Please check this PR and check the description for necessary actions: [#PR 1027](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/1027)**
  :::

- **Enforced Minimum File Size for Uploaded Files in CRM** This update ensures that files smaller than the configured minimum size (including 0 bytes) cannot be uploaded in the CRM. Administrators can easily adjust the minimum file size in the configuration file, preventing the upload of empty or invalid files and enhancing data integrity across the platform. [#PR 980](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/980)

- **Visualize Survey Responses in Detail View** This update adds a feature to the SurveyResponse detail view, allowing users to visualize survey responses in a clear and organized table format. This enhancement improves the readability and analysis of survey data.[#PR 906](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/906)

- **Improved ListView and Export API Performance by Optimizing Query** This update removes an unnecessary OR condition from the ListView and Export API queries, which was slowing down performance. Since NULL values are not present in the "deleted" column, the condition is no longer needed, resulting in faster data loading, especially in modules with large datasets. [#PR 927](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/927)

- **Optimized ACL Checks to Improve List View Performance** In SimpleCRM v300, excessive queries were causing delays when using the list view, as ACL (Access Control List) checks were being performed for every record, even those without security groups. This led to repeated access checks for actions like list, view, edit, delete, export, import, create, and download.
  To resolve this, we optimized the process by limiting ACL checks only to records associated with a security group, reducing unnecessary checks and significantly improving performance. [#PR 936](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/936)

- **Enhanced Basic Search to Include Labels Field from API**
  The basic search placeholder in the ListView now dynamically displays the field name, sourced directly from the API. This enhancement ensures that the search field labels are consistent with the data provided by the API, improving the user experience and aligning with backend updates. [#PR 1410](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v300_new/pull/1410)

- **Disable News Search Option in Top Navigation by Default with Configurable Toggle** We have disabled the "News Search" feature from the top navigation bar in the baseline configuration. This feature can still be enabled for any specific project by modifying the config_override.php file.[#PR 985](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/985).

- **Accurate Expected Date Calculation for Holiday Record Creation** This update improves the expected date calculation logic for records created on holidays. It now correctly identifies whether today is a holiday and adjusts the expected date accordingly. If today is a holiday, the system will use the next working day with appropriate opening and closing hours, ensuring accurate timelines for record processing. [#PR 727](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/727).

- **Enhancement:Rectifying Blank Space Removal in Filter Sort Order Field** An unnecessary blank option was previously included in the sort-order field within the filter settings, alongside the ascending and descending choices. This blank value cluttered the user interface and caused confusion for users. By eliminating the blank option, the sort-order field has been streamlined, enhancing the overall user experience and clarity in the sorting functionality.[#PR 736](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/736)

- **Enhanced Inbound Email Account Management Options** New options have been added to the panel for managing inbound email accounts, allowing users to easily create both personal and group email accounts directly. The previous buttons for creating these accounts have been disabled, streamlining the process and providing users with direct access to create the inbound email accounts they need. [#PR 840](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/840)

- **User-Specific Redirects on Login** This update introduces user-specific redirects upon login.

  - Admin users are redirected to the Administration Panel list.
  - Regular users are redirected to their profile view.
  - This enhancement ensures users are directed to the appropriate interface based on their role, improving navigation efficiency. [#PR 1011](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/1011)

- **Display Both Active and Inactive Users in "Assign to" Field for Better Ticket Tracking** This update addresses an issue where inactive users with assigned tickets do not appear in the "Assign to" field within the search view, making it difficult to find tickets assigned to them. By modifying the getSearchView() function to retrieve all users (active and inactive) without filtering by status, the system will now display both active and inactive users, ensuring more comprehensive ticket tracking and assignment visibility. [#PR 1017](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/1017)
- **Restrict Editing of Key Fields for Regular Users** This update restricts regular users from editing specific fields, including Username, User Type, Status, and Reporting Manager, ensuring these important fields can only be modified by authorized users. This limitation helps maintain data integrity and control over essential user information. [#PR 1019](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/1019)
- **Improved Performance for Security Group Role Queries** We‚Äôve enhanced the performance of role-related queries in environments with many security groups. By adding indices to the securitygroup_id and role_id columns in the securitygroups_acl_roles table, queries to fetch roles for a security group are now faster and more efficient. [#PR 975](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/975)

- **OAuth2 Refresh Token Issue Resolved in V8 API** The OAuth2 refresh token functionality in the V8 API was not working correctly. This has been addressed with the necessary updates to restore proper token refresh behavior. [#PR 944](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/944)

- **Subpanel Reordering Feature Added for V3 Record Detail View** A new functionality has been introduced to allow reordering of subpanels in the record detail view, which was previously unavailable in V3. Custom code has been added to the system, enabling admin users to reorder subpanels via V267, and these changes will automatically apply to all users across the system. [#PR 951](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/951)

- **Optimized Escalation Date Calculation for Improved Performance** The logic for calculating escalation dates has been optimized to enhance performance. Previously, multiple SQL queries for non-working days, holidays, and user leave slowed down the process. Now, data is collected once, and calculations are done in a single step, with non-working days calculated recursively, leading to improved efficiency. [#PR 921](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/921)

- **Improvements to BPM Step Order, Assignment Scheduling, and User Comparisons** BPM steps are now correctly ordered by creation date to avoid issues with step display, especially in MSSQL. Completed steps and BPMs no longer trigger unnecessary assignments, streamlining scheduler behavior. Additionally, user ID comparisons for the "Next Step" button are now case-insensitive and trimmed to prevent errors with migrated user data. [#PR 946](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/946)

- **Optimize History Subpanel Performance** This update enhances the performance of the history subpanel by restructuring its queries. It removes unnecessary contact and email relationships from the history query for cases, improving efficiency. Additionally, hardcoded OR conditions have been replaced with IN clauses in various module subpanels, resulting in better readability and performance throughout the application. [#PR 948](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/948)

- **Compatibility Update for Next Step Button in MSSQL Environments** This update resolves an issue with the Next Step button functionality in MSSQL database environments by adding a conditional check for db_type. When the database type is MSSQL, the API now executes the appropriate query, ensuring consistent operation across different database systems. [#PR 913](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/913)

- **Performance Boost by Removing Unused Alert and Favorites API Calls in v267** Removed unnecessary background API calls for alerts and favorites in v267, where top navigation and corresponding features are not visible. These optimizations eliminate redundant processes, enhancing overall application performance for users. [#PR 969](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/969)

- **Enhanced ListView Performance with Optimized Record Counts, User Data, and Subpanel Loading**  
  This update improves ListView performance by optimizing record count retrieval, directly querying user full names, and reducing redundant SQL calls and bean initializations, leading to faster response times and better resource efficiency in high-load scenarios. [#PR 972](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/972)

- **Streamlining Custom Module Logic Hooks** This update removes unused logic hooks from the custom module to enhance performance during create, update, delete, and mass update operations. By eliminating redundant hooks, the codebase is simplified, leading to faster execution and easier future maintenance.[#PR 983](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/983)

### Bug Fixes

- - **Surveys Module Button in Left-Side Drawer (v267)** In version 267, a "Surveys Module" button was added to the left-side drawer for easier access. Regular users see this button only if they have access to the Surveys module, while admins can view it regardless of permissions. In the Survey Response Module's detail view, there's a known issue where the "Assigned To" field does not display values; this will be resolved in the next release. Additionally, edit, add, and delete actions are now restricted for both the Surveys and Survey Response modules in V3 to enhance data security and control. [#PR 1012](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/1012)
- **Fix Bug in History Subpanel - Email Values Displaying as Decoded HTML** The email record values in the History subpanel were previously displaying in a decoded format. This issue has been resolved by wrapping all value keys with the html_entity_decode function to properly encode the values, ensuring they display correctly in the subpanel. [#PR 1014](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/1014)

- **Fixed Issue Where Deleting a Module Caused BPM Configuration List to Show a Blank Page** Now, the system checks if a module is valid before trying to load it. If the module no longer exists, the system will skip it, ensuring the BPM list works smoothly without errors. [#PR 968](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/968)

- **Subpanel Count Display Issue Resolved for Workflow and Related Modules** The count of records in the "Process Audit" subpanel of the Workflow module was previously not visible. This issue also affected the "Scheduler," "Roles," and "Security Group" subpanels. To resolve this, we updated the configuration to ensure these modules are properly included, allowing the counts to display correctly. [#PR 912](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/912)

- **Preventing Spaces in Usernames and Disabling Unused Active Date Code** Usernames cannot contain spaces (e.g., "Pournima Shende" is invalid, while "pournimashende" is valid). To enforce this rule, we have implemented validation on both the API and V267 sides. If a user attempts to enter a username with spaces, an error message will prompt them to correct it. [#PR 911](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/911)

- **Disable AOD for .DOCX File Uploads and Add Decimal Type for Opportunity Scoring**
  When users upload a .docx file, an error occurs during saving. This has been fixed by disabling the AOD feature in the configuration file with `$sugar_config['aod']['enable_aod'] = false;`. The `opportunity_scoring_c` field type has also been changed to 'Decimal' for improved accuracy.[#PR 916](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/916)

- **Sync Users Popup List View with Studio Configuration**
  The popup ListView was incorrectly displaying user data instead of the layout set in Studio. We removed the overriding condition, ensuring the popup now reflects the Studio configuration. Sorting and searching functionalities have been verified to work correctly. [#PR 923](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/923)

- **"Show Full Names" Option Now Displays Full Names Correctly** Resolved an issue where the "Show Full Names" option in system settings wasn't working correctly. Instead of showing full names, the frontend was displaying usernames in the list and detail views. A flag check has been added in the query logic to ensure that when this option is enabled, the assigned user's full name is displayed as expected. [#PR 973](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/973)

- **Improved Error Display and UI in SAML Login** The error display in the SAML login screen has been corrected to ensure proper visibility of error messages. UI issues affecting the SAML login screen have also been resolved, providing a smoother user experience. [#PR 935](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/935)

- **Improved MSID Handling for V267 Login Under Load Balancing** In V267, login issues occurred when using load balancing due to improper session sharing for MSID, causing authentication failures. The current workaround involves passing an encrypted access token instead of MSID in the iframe URL to create the session. [#PR 945](https://github.com/simplecrm-projects/simplecrm_v267/pull/945)
